Space Invaders Game: Shoot down the rows of alien invaders that descend from the top of the screen while avoiding their attacks...


Description: A fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting downward (advancing on the shooter) each time they reach a screen edge.
